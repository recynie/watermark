I'm wondering if there's some chemical reaction that causes redness when the blood has iron in it. Is this something we can figure out?\n\nYes. Iron in red blood cells is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe2+). Ferric iron reacts with oxygen to form ferrous iron (Fe3+) and ferric hydroxide (FeOH), which forms red blood cell walls. The ferric ions in red blood cell membranes also act as a source of oxygen, which makes them more susceptible to oxidative stress.

We propose a method that allows us to choose between several different strategies depending on the parameters chosen by the user and the objective function. In particular, we propose two different methods for the optimization problem of a single-parameter machine learning algorithm. The first one is a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which is used to find the optimal strategy in the presence of a fixed number of parameters. This algorithm can be used to optimize the parameters of a linear system with a fixed number k. The second one is a gradient descent (GDD) algorithm, also called a greedy algorithm. This algorithm is designed to find the best strategy for a linear system whose parameters are not known. It can be used in the presence or absence of a fixed amount of information.\nThe paper will focus mainly on two different approaches to the", "generated_score": 3.9597980976104736, "attacked_answer": "", "attacked_score": NaN, "delta": NaN}

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following instruction: \nSummarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "generated_answer": " In the Middle Ages, mathematical concepts were used in the construction of churches, monasteries, and castles, including the great cathedral at Canterbury, England, which was built in 1215.\nIn modern art, mathematics is also employed in a variety other areas. For example, the geometric shapes that appear in the works of the Dutch painter Rembrandt are often expressed mathematically. The geometric patterns in the paintings of the Italian Renaissance painter Michelangelo, who was also a mathematician, are also mathematically expressed. The mathematical symbols used in the paintings and sculptures of the American abstract expressionist painter Robert Rauschenberg are also expressed mathematically, although the exact meaning is not known. The mathematical notation used in the works by the French painter Jean Dubuffet is also highly symbolic, but the meaning of these symbols is unknown.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models", "generated_answer": " use complex recurrent or multi-layered convolutional networks that include a central encoding unit and multiple layers of decoders.

However, these models also suffer from the limitations of convolutional architectures, including a high degree of interconnection between the layers, which makes them more susceptible to error.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a 'phoneme.' Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following instruction: \nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains.
