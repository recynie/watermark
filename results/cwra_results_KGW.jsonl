{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following instruction: \nExplain me the Finite Elemente Method\n", "generated_answer": "\nThe finite element method is a mathematical approach that uses finite elements to solve problems. The finite element method can be used to analyze a system and determine its structure and behavior. The finite elements method is a way of solving problems that involve the analysis of a system. The finite-element method is a technique for solving problems that involves the analysis of the structure and behavior of a system using a finite set of elements. The finite set of finite elements may be used to represent the system. The method is useful for determining how the system will behave. The finite size of the elements allows the system to be modeled in terms of a finite set. The finite number of elements allows the finite elements to represent the entire system. The system may be modeled as a series of finite elements. The method can also be used to model systems that have multiple dimensions or multiple states. The finite state method is a different type of finite-element based modeling.

You can also use them to write type safe JavaScript code that runs faster than native code (which means it's less memory-intensive).\nThe idea of this is very similar to how you could build a compiler that checks the types of your code before compiling it. However, with TypeScript you don't have to worry about compiling the code, because it's already checked at compile time.

The problem is that there's not really much information in the image itself. You need to know which pixels are high contrast or low contrast. If we have an image with a high contrast image and a low contrast image side-by-side then it's easy to see that the low contrast image has more information than the high contrast image (because it's higher contrast). So, we want to make the low contrast images as high contrast as possible. We do this by using a technique called stable diffusion. In other words, we use a technique to increase contrast without making the image too noisy. The way we do this is by using a gradient. The gradient is a series of steps that we take on the image so that we can get a good result from the algorithm. The first step is that we create a gradient.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following instruction: \nSummarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "generated_answer": " In the Middle Ages, mathematicians and artists were closely associated with each other. The mathematician John of Damascus was a member of the court of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI Palaiologos (ruled 1327–1369) who commissioned him to design a new cathedral in Constantinople.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a 'phoneme.' Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "generated_answer": " We conclude that FewJoint can be used to improve the quality of joint learning in the few shot setting.", "generated_score": 2.836832573067901, "attacked_answer": " We concluded that FewJoint can be used to improve the quality of joint learning in several lens environments.
