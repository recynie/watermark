Are there any limits to the speed at which prices adjust to market changes?\n\nTaleb is a widely known political commentator, economist, and philosopher, known for having a wealth of experiences in both quantitative analysis of the stock market and philosophy as applied to the stock market. As a result of this wealth of wisdom in addition to his ability to give practical advice on the subject many have credited him with the notion that \"finance is a gambling business\", and by extension, a market is a gambling market. Taleb's notion of the gambler as the protagonist of the stock-picking process makes the point clear.\n\nTaleb's notion of \"market efficiency\" states that stock-picking is an efficient decision-making process, whereas the stock-pickers are not making rational and logical investments, since they are making decisions driven by emotion and herd mentality, and they are making short term decisions where the costs to be paid in terms of loss or gain do not justify making an absolute \"long or short\" decision.

This may also be the best choice when using the paper format as input to Google Maps or other apps. \n\nAdvantages of handwritten form: \nUnderstanding map details better is always an advantage. When choosing a tool, paper maps have the unique ability to preserve, copy, and edit detailed map information, as well as preserve early maps, making them more flexible.", "attacked_score": -1.466471150213533, "delta": 11.035397758545502}
