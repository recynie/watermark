If it's the latter, here goes:\nSexual Selection (or Sex Selection) refers to the evolutionary advantage that females gain from mating with certain individuals in order to increase the probability that they will produce offspring that are similar to them in appearance and characteristics. This advantage can be used to select for traits that are desirable to the individual and that are also beneficial to the species as a whole (i.e., traits that are beneficial to the organism). For example, if you were to select for the ability to produce large amounts of children, you would probably select for traits such as large breasts and large hips that are beneficial for the species overall. The same applies to traits that are detrimental to the organism (i. e., traits that cause disease or other problems).

The main idea behind DP is to solve problems by using variables and loops to control the number of times the variable gets called or the loop runs. This way the program can run infinitely fast without any limit on the number of variables and loops that can be used. For example, if you have a program that takes 5 minutes to complete and you need to finish it in 2 minutes, you could use the loop to count how many times the variable x gets called and then use the variable y to calculate the time it takes to complete the program. If you know the time it would take to complete the whole program in 2 minutes you can use the loop again to calculate the number of loops needed to complete the same program in 2 seconds. In this case you only need one variable and one loop to calculate the same time. This can also be used to solve problems involving time and money.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "generated_answer": " In the 19th century, the mathematical physicist and engineer George Brouwer published the Brouwer-Rochon theorem that proved that the volume of any closed volume can be expressed in terms of the area and the area under the curve of the volume.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a 'phoneme.' Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse", "generated_answer": " this question into one that can be answered by reading the article or the abstract and answering the question in the same sentence.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following instruction: \nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "generated_answer": " We also provide an experimental proof-of-concept for the proposed scheme by using it to model the dialogues in the real API and the code platform. Finally, we conclude that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the joint learning capabilities in the few shot setting and make the joint learning easier and faster in the few shots scenario.\n\nThe paper presents an efficient and scalable framework for the training and inference of deep convolutional networks (CNNs). The framework allows the training and the inference of CNNs in the presence of large amounts of data and without any knowledge about the underlying architecture or the network topology. The framework also allows the training of CNNs on sparse data sets and allows the inference of the CNNs on large data sets without any knowledge of the underlying architecture and the network topologies. The framework can be used to train CNNs on both sparse and large data sets and can also be used to perform inference on CNNs on the sparse data sets.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant, please answer the following instruction: \nHow can you determine if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists, and why might this information be useful?\n", "generated_answer": "I'm not sure how to interpret your question. If you mean that you want to know whether people who frequent restaurants in your area are local or tourists (and thus would prefer to avoid them), then it depends on the location and the time of year. If you are asking about the number of people who visit restaurants in general, then it depends also on the time of the year and the season. For example, during the summer months (June-August) many people go out for dinner and drinks and so they tend to visit restaurants more frequently than during the winter months (November-March). This may explain the higher number of visitors to restaurants in the summer months than in the winter months. In addition, the number of visitors may vary from one year to another due to seasonal factors (like the number of tourists visiting the area during the winter or the number of local residents traveling to the area during certain times of the year).
