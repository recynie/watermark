Here is a general guide to making snails in an emergency:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1/3 cup rice (I prefer to use brown rice because it naturally contains a lot of fiber)\n- 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice\n- Miso (a delicious Japanese cooking liquid)\n- Soy sauce\n- Green onions (for color)", "attacked_score": -0.2532511055469513, "delta": 3.4427771866321564}

{"prompt": "What do the different octane values of gasoline mean?", "generated_answer": "What do the different octane values of gasoline mean? They mean that gasoline will break down a car engine, or your car will slow down and burn a lot of gas. Of course, it has something to do with the octane in gasoline. It is important to note that there is a huge difference in price between a premium and a regular gasoline. Premium gasoline tends to have a stronger octane rating compared to regular. It comes as a result of adding anti-retarding chemicals to the tank mix so that it does not quickly break down inside the engine.\n\nTo ensure that gasoline does not quickly deteriorate, or run out, spark plug manufacturers will require regular test burns on their spark plugs. The burned tests force the spark plugs to age before they can be recycled by the engine. This is one of the long-lasting benefits of a good spark plug. They also add a little more wear to the spark plugs and can thus allow for easier maintenance. One thing to note though is that it is your driver's responsibility to change these spark plugs annually when", "generated_score": 4.371520519256592, "attacked_answer": "What do different octane ratings of gasoline represent?\nThey imply that gasoline can damage the car engine, or that your car will slow down and consume a large amount of gasoline. Of course, this is related to the octane rating of the gasoline. It is noteworthy that there is a significant price difference between premium gasoline and regular gasoline. Premium gasoline usually has a higher octane rating than regular gasoline. This is due to the addition of anti-aging chemicals in the fuel mixture to prevent it from decomposing rapidly within the engine.\n\nTo ensure that gasoline does not deteriorate or deplete quickly, spark plug manufacturers require regular test burns of their spark plugs. The burn test forces the spark plug to age before it can be recycled by the engine. This is one of the lasting benefits of premium spark plugs.

When your favorite hot beverage gets warmer, do you get much warmer, or does it make you more tired? Think about your temperature around your home and where it is getting its warmth. Once you have determined what is the source of warmth in your home, you may find that if you have an open window in one room, the warm air may also be able to enter another room.\nThe effects of home temperature can be reduced by closing windows to raise humidity and increasing air flow for a home in a low climate or by closing windows during colder weather to keep the temperature higher. A simple cooling fan in your home with small fans is a great way to warm your home using air that has already been heated indoors.

Yes, stainless steel can be magnetized and attracted to certain types of objects due to its high magnetic permeability compared to many ferromagnetic materials.

Power of Option: Tenants have more flexibility when it comes down to rent control than landlords. For instance, someone who has a long-term lease can bargain with the landlord based on a term longer than a short-term lease might do.

If the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads or tails on the first flip is equal, and the probability of getting heads or tails on the second flip is also equal.\n\nCourse: If a set of three variables changes independently by changing one of them, then the set of variables is called mutually independent.

One common grammar tip for ending a German verb is to add an ending at the end of the verb.

By using the suffix -er with the verb \"sind\" to indicate the past participle of \"sind,\" you can create a simple present tense sentence in German.\nAnother common tip is to use the verb \"zählen\" as the past tense form, which ends in -zieren.
