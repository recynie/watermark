In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing.

It allows for increased flexibility in employee scheduling and reduces the risk of burnout among employees who work from home. Additionally, it can lead to improved collaboration and communication between employees, as they have more time to focus on their tasks. The potential drawbacks may include decreased productivity due to lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues, difficulty in monitoring progress or feedback, and the possibility of losing control over the workplace if an unexpected incident occurs (such as a power outage).

This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nOne of the key advantages of quantum computers is their ability to handle complex problems that classical computers cannot solve efficiently. For example, they have been used to develop algorithms for simulating molecules, solving optimization problems, and even breaking encryption codes. Additionally, quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize fields such as drug discovery, finance, and logistics by enabling more efficient problem-solving.\n\nHowever, building and running a quantum computer is still a challenging task due to its complexity.

As a result, this can lead to selective consumption of news, where only those pieces of content that align with one's own beliefs are shared.\n\nThe potential implications for spreading misinformation are significant.

It refers to the mechanism by which individuals with traits that confer a competitive advantage can pass on those traits to their offspring. Over time, this leads to changes in population fitness due to increased genetic diversity.\n\nThe key components of natural selection include:\n\n1. **Genetic Variation**: Populations have different combinations of genes because they inherit them from parents who may have different genotypes or alleles (versions) of the same gene.\n\n2. **Adaptability vs. Inadaptability**: Populations vary in their ability to adapt to environmental conditions. Those groups that can better survive and reproduce will tend to have more offspring than others, leading to greater genetic variation within each group.\n\n3. **Survival and Reproduction**: The survival of individuals depends on whether they are successful in reproducing successfully.
