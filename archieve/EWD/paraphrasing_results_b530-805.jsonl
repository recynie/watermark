Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "generated_answer": " Mathematics is also found in calligraphy, including hieroglyphic script, cursive script, and mathematical notation.\n\nMathematics and Art - History and Current Use\nIn both history and contemporary practice, there exists a close connection between mathematics and artistic expression.

Contemporary artists continue to draw upon these same aesthetic principles through various means such as using the Golden Ratio in art, exploring symmetry in nature and architecture, and employing fractals and hyperbolas in their work.\n\nMathematicians, particularly those working within the fields of algebra, geometry, and number theory, have made significant contributions to understanding the mathematical structures underlying artistic phenomena.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a 'phoneme.' Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains.

First, we need to understand what it means for something to be 'ready' or 'cooked'. Ready usually implies that something is done in preparation or is about to be done, while cooked refers to being done with heat applied.\n\n2. In the context of cooking and eating, it makes more sense to say that something is 'finished' or 'done', not just 'ready'.\n\n3. Therefore, we can rephrase the original sentence by focusing on the action rather than the result:\n   - Instead of 'the chicken is ready...', we can say 'the chicken has finished'.\n   - Or, if you prefer, we could use 'the chicken was cooked'.\n\n4.

This property allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations simultaneously.\n\nAnother key feature of quantum computers is superposition, where an electron can exist in multiple states at once. This means that a single qubit can represent two different states simultaneously, enabling quantum computers to process information much more efficiently than classical computers.\n\nQuantum algorithms also rely on quantum entanglement, where two or more particles become linked in such a way that their state cannot be described separately.

This can be done through budgetary measures such as cutting social programs or raising taxes. By doing so, it creates a reduction in consumer spending and business investment, leading to lower demand and potential recession.\n\nMonetary policy, on the other hand, involves adjusting interest rates to influence borrowing and lending activities. When interest rates are too low, businesses may borrow more, leading to higher inflation. On the flip side, when interest rates are high, businesses may hold off on investing, leading to reduced consumption. Both of these factors contribute to slowing down economic growth.\n\nCombining both approaches can help mitigate the effects of an economic downturn.
